On Friday, Sept. 14, I will be speaking on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) at the [Business Analysis Professional Development Day](http://2012iibacolumbuspdd-eac2.eventbrite.com) at The Conference Center at NorthPointe in Lewis Center, Ohio.

The [Columbus Chapter](http://columbusoh.iiba.org ) of the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) is sponsoring the event.
######About Behavior Driven Development
Gathering requirements is a challenging endeavor. Encoding them in such a way that they can be understood, managed, verifiable and used by multiple people with different backgrounds brings this endeavor to an art form.

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an outside-in software development approach that focuses on the value the requirement provides. Requirements are encoded in a testable format so that the software can built in a natural manner.

My presentation will introduce key BDD concepts and help get people started on their own BDD path.
