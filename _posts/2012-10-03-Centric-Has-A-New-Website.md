I work for [Centric Consulting](http://www.centricconsulting.com/), and we have a new website.  A lot of people have been working hard for quite a long time to make this happen and I think the results are outstanding.

It's very metro.  I'm very impressed with how easy it is to use and find the content you are looking for (especially for the [Application Development](http://www.centricconsulting.com/application-development/) and [Application Lifecycle Management](http://www.centricconsulting.com/application-lifecycle-management/) service offering pages).

Please check it out and let us know what you think.
