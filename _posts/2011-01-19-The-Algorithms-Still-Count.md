<div>
As per normal, <a href="http://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash </a>last week was awesome.  I was lucky enough to be</div>
<div>
chosen as a presenter.  The topic, <a href="http://codemash.org/Sessions#The+Algorithms+Still+Count">"The Algorithms Still Count"</a>.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In our world great frameworks and tools abound that help us be</div>
<div>
productive and build awesome applications that make our customers</div>
<div>
happy.  Many of the inner working of the features we build are</div>
<div>
abstracted away from us.  But often times we are called to solve more</div>
<div>
complex problems and we have to design and implement solutions that solve those</div>
<div>
problems accurately. Now the "right tool for the right job" is our</div>
<div>
brain and how we use that tool will decide if our application will be</div>
<div>
useful to our clients and scale appropriately to their audience.</div>
<div>
