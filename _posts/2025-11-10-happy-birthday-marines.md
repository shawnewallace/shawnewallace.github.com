**On November 10, 2025, the United States Marine Corps turns 250 years old.**  
It all began in [Tun Tavern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tun_Tavern) in 1775 — yes, the Marine Corps was founded in a bar — and ever since, Marines have built a legacy of service, sacrifice, and dependability that continues to this day.

I had the honor of serving in the Marine Corps from 1990 to 1996. What follows is a short reflection on that time — the people I served alongside and the lessons that still shape how I live and work today.

The Marine Corps’ story is written by countless individuals over centuries — from 1st Lieutenant [Presley O'Bannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presley_O%27Bannon) and Major General [Smedley Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler), to legends like Lieutenant General [Chesty Puller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesty_Puller), heroes such as Medal of Honor recipients Gunnery Sergeant [John Basilone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Basilone), Corporal [Kyle Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Carpenter), and Sergeant [Dakota Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Meyer).

Each generation adds its own small piece to that legacy. I was fortunate to serve among good Marines, dependable people who showed up every day and did the work, no matter the conditions.

> “No better friend, no worse enemy.”  
> — Traditional Marine saying  

That saying has always meant more to me than just battlefield talk. It’s a reminder that strength and compassion can coexist — that reliability and loyalty are what others should be able to count on, whether in uniform or not.

> "Retreat? Hell, we just got here!"  
> — Attributed to Capt. Lloyd W. Williams (Battle of Belleau Wood, 1918); motto of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment

Those words were shouted during the **Battle of Belleau Wood in World War I (1918)**, one of the defining moments in Marine Corps history. Facing overwhelming German forces, the Marines attacked and turned the tide of battle. Their ferocity in combat earned them a nickname from the enemy itself, *Teufel Hunden* ("Devil Dogs"). That stubborn resolve, the refusal to quit when things get difficult, became a hallmark of the Corps and remains a model of grit and reliability to this day.

> “Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?”  
> — Sgt. Maj. Dan Daly  

That line came from **Sergeant Major Dan Daly**, a two-time Medal of Honor recipient who led his Marines in a charge at Belleau Wood. It captures the courage and determination that defined that fight, and the Marine Corps itself. Daly’s words weren’t about bravado; they were about leadership and standing up when it mattered most. That same quiet accountability, to do your part and not let others down, becomes second nature. I’ve found that to be one of the most lasting gifts of service.

> “The Marines I have seen around the world have the cleanest bodies, the filthiest minds, the highest morale, and the lowest morals of any group of animals I have ever seen. Thank God for the United States Marine Corps!”  
> — Eleanor Roosevelt, 1945  

Marines have long been a study in contrasts: tough but kind, disciplined yet irreverent. That mix of grit and humor gets you through long days and harder nights, and it builds a kind of trust that lasts well beyond the years of active duty.

Ask any Marine what they remember most, and it usually isn’t a battle or an award. It’s the people: the routine and the knowledge that you could depend on each other, every single day.

Years later, reunions remind us that the bond endures — that even as life moves on, the trust you built together never really fades.

The Marine Corps taught me many things, but above all, it taught me to be dependable, to do the job, to support the team, and to keep faith with those who rely on you. Those lessons have carried through every season of my life.

**To every Marine past and present, happy birthday, and thank you for keeping the standard high.**  
Because Marines never really leave the service (once a Marine, always a Marine), **Semper Fidelis.**
