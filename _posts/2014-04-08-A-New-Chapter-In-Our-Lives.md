This is not a technical or IT related post.  It is a very personal letter to a congregation of people I have been associated with since I was 5 years old.

To The Saints at the Soutwestern Church of Christ,

It is the responsibility of a mother and father to give a child a spiritual education. The local congregation of believers are a great aid to the parents and do much to support a child throughout their youth. We believe that as a teenager a child benefits in many ways from a robust and professionally led youth group. As a child grows, so do her needs. We believe that a solid youth group does much to equip a child for future life in Jesus. While Southwestern loves their children and wants the best for them, as a congregation we do not have nor are we able to support an active youth group or a professional youth minister (both of which we believe are critical). We believe that our children need to be involved somewhere that can. We do not desire to coerce, make ultimatums, drain resources or ask Southwestern to do something they cannot practically support.

It is reluctantly that we inform you that we will be leaving Southwestern to seek out and join a congregation that has a mature, established and Christ-centered youth program. Effective immediately, please remove the Wallace family from membership and rolls at the Southwestern Church of Christ. Also effective immediately, we remove ourselves from under the authority of the elders at the Southwestern Church of Christ. We do desire to remain in fellowship with the saints there.

Carolyn and I have attended Southwestern for 20+ and 37+ years respectively and we love our family there, but this is a decision we make with our children in mind however difficult it might be. We wish nothing but awesome things for Southwestern as you serve God, his people and grow. We will pray for the saints there daily. We ask and trust you will do the same for us.

In Jesus,

Shawn and Carolyn Wallace
