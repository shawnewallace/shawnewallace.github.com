My high school offensive line coach always told us:

>You are either getting better or getting worse.  You never stay the same.

This is so true.  The moment you stop learning and examining yourself to get better, you begin your decline.  Often you have to take a break to get better because it's hard to get better while you are going hard.

This is doubly true for teams.  Teams often go 'pedal to the metal' for months on end and do not take the time to self examine.  In my world we try to take this time periodically in a retrospective meeting.  Too often these meetings are more necessarily tactical and don't bubble up the big ideas or are sufficiently at a low level to even see them.

>We're pretty good, but we need to get better.

Periodiocally we need to take a step back and take measure of ourselves versus our ideal or just our next set of goals.  We need to see what our team looks like at the next level.  We need to mature.

##We Still Have Pain
The are some practical considerations as well.  We still have things that we are not doing very well.  In software, as we add features we rarely remove others.  The same is true of other things that are part of our project.  We might need to scale up our teams.  Something we changed in our last retrospective could have surfaced some other problem or inefficiency.

##Mature process

* True Test First
* Better Engineering to support OOP and testing.
* Better Craftsmanship
* Roll in Reporting to Show Emphasis
* More Automation vs. Manual testing
* Test the Mainframe (all systems in ecosystem)
* Get skeptics on board.
* More pairing/less code review
* Merge ba/dev/test roles
* JavaScript?
