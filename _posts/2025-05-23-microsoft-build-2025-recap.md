## Introduction

This year's Microsoft Build conference held in Seattle brought together developers from around the world to explore the latest innovations in AI, cloud computing, and developer tools. With thousands of attendees and hundreds of sessions, the event showcased Microsoft's continued commitment to empowering developers with cutting-edge technology. I attended with my colleague [Michael Collier](https://www.michaelscollier.com), and together we covered as many sessions as possible. Here's my recap of the highlights from each day. I've also collected a number of [valuable resources and links](#key-resources-and-links) for those interested in exploring these topics further.

It's worth noting that other [Centric Consulting](https://www.centricconsulting.com) colleagues like [Donnie Kerr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakerr/) have already started to take these learnings and are working quickly to make use of the new tooling announced at Build. The impact of these announcements is already being felt across our organization as we integrate these innovations into our client solutions. Check out [Donnie's 'Tech in 10'](https://www.youtube.com/@donniekerr9091) videos which highlihghts new features in 10 minute or less videos.

## My Key Takeaways

After attending sessions over the three days, a few core themes emerged that I believe will shape the future of software development:

1. **AI Agents as the New Building Blocks**: It's clear that AI agents are becoming the fundamental building blocks of modern information systems. Microsoft is positioning them as composable units that can be orchestrated to solve complex problems.

2. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Throughout the conference, Microsoft emphasized a "human in the loop" approach. Rather than replacing developers, AI is being positioned as a powerful collaborator that amplifies human creativity and productivity.

3. **Agent Orchestration Standards**: The industry is solidifying around standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication for orchestrating complex AI systems. This standardization will be crucial for interoperability as agent ecosystems grow.

4. **Inclusive AI Tooling**: I was impressed by the range of AI tools available across different skill levels - from no-code solutions for business users to advanced frameworks for professional developers, making AI accessible to everyone.

5. **AI-Powered Development**: The demos showing agents handling development tasks and work items were particularly impressive. GitHub's new capability to assign work items directly to AI agents could significantly change how development teams operate.

6. **.NET Aspire Maturation**: The advancements in .NET Aspire are creating a significantly better and more productive developer experience for complex distributed systems. It's impressive to see how Aspire is simplifying the development, deployment (coming soon), and management/monitoring of these sophisticated applications.

## Day 1: The Future of AI Development

Day 1 set the tone for the entire conference with a strong focus on AI innovation. Microsoft's vision for AI agents as fundamental building blocks for modern applications was clearly articulated, along with practical implementations through Azure AI Foundry and GitHub Copilot enhancements.

## A Note on Day 4 and Session Recordings

Although I was unable to attend Day 4 due to travel requirements, I'm looking forward to watching the recorded sessions once they become available. Microsoft has announced that all Build 2025 sessions will soon be publicly available for anyone to watch online, making this wealth of knowledge accessible to the broader developer community.

## Conclusion

Microsoft Build 2025 demonstrated the company's continued innovation in AI, cloud, and developer tools. The announcements and sessions provided valuable insights into the future of software development, with a clear emphasis on responsible AI and developer productivity. As AI agents become increasingly central to how we build and operate software, Microsoft is clearly positioning itself at the forefront of this transformation while emphasizing collaborative approaches that keep humans at the center of the development process.

One thing I've always been impressed with about Microsoft is their focus on developers and the development experience. This year's Build conference reinforced that commitment, showing how even as technology evolves rapidly toward AI-driven solutions, Microsoft continues to prioritize making developers more productive and successful. Whether through .NET Aspire's streamlined approach to complex systems or the thoughtful integration of AI agents into development workflows, it's clear that empowering developers remains at the core of Microsoft's strategy.
