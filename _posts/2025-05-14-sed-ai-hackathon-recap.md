Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in an internal AI hackathon at Centric Consulting, focused on building an AI-powered insurance claim triage system. The challenge was based on a fictional scenario involving Censurance, a hypothetical insurance company. The hackathon brought together talented developers, engineers, and AI enthusiasts from across our organization to tackle a real-world challenge in insurance claim processing.

## The Challenge

The hackathon centered around building an AI-powered API that could revolutionize how insurance claims are processed. In our fictional scenario, it takes Censurance staff 2-3 days to review each claim manually, causing customer frustration and leaving room for undetected fraud. Teams were tasked with building a proof-of-concept API that could:

- Classify claims into categories (Urgent, Routine, Potential Fraud, or Needs More Information)
- Provide AI-generated rationales for each classification
- Include confidence scores and metadata for logging
- Handle edge cases and ambiguous claims
- Implement semantic logging for transparency

## Team Approaches

What made this internal hackathon particularly interesting was the diversity of approaches taken by the three teams:

1. **Low-Code/No-Code Solution**: One team leveraged a low-code approach, creating an MCP server with an agent workflow. This solution demonstrated how AI can be integrated into existing systems with minimal traditional coding, making it accessible to a broader range of developers.

2. **.NET API with GitHub Copilot**: Another team built a .NET API, using GitHub Copilot to accelerate development. They integrated Microsoft's Semantic Kernel with an AI model to process and classify claims, showcasing how AI can assist in building AI solutions.

3. **Agent C Platform**: The third team utilized our [Agent C Framework](https://github.com/centricconsulting/agent_c_framework), an open-source framework for building interactive, tool-using AI agents. This approach highlighted the potential of agentic AI systems in automating complex business processes.

## Quality Assurance

A crucial aspect of the hackathon was ensuring both the quality of our solutions and their effectiveness in meeting business needs. This dual focus on technical and functional quality led to several important considerations:

1. **Software Quality**:
   - Unit testing of classification logic
   - Integration testing of API endpoints
   - Performance testing under load
   - Security review of AI model interactions
   - Code quality and maintainability

2. **Solution Validation**:
   - Accuracy of claim classifications
   - Consistency of AI-generated rationales
   - Handling of edge cases and ambiguous claims
   - Transparency of decision-making process
   - User experience and interface design

3. **Business Requirements**:
   - Meeting the 2-3 day processing time reduction goal
   - Fraud detection effectiveness
   - Scalability for production use
   - Integration with existing systems
   - Cost-effectiveness of the solution

4. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Token usage monitoring and optimization
   - Balancing model complexity with cost
   - Caching strategies for similar claims
   - Batch processing where appropriate
   - Cost per claim analysis and optimization

This focus on quality assurance helped ensure that our solutions weren't just technically sound, but also truly valuable for the business case. It highlighted the importance of having both technical and business perspectives in the development process. The cost considerations were particularly important, as they directly impact the feasibility of implementing AI solutions in production environments. Teams had to carefully balance the quality of AI-generated responses with the associated costs, ensuring that the benefits of automation outweighed the expenses of running the AI models.

## Key Learnings

The hackathon provided several valuable insights:

1. **AI Integration**: We learned how to effectively integrate AI models into existing development workflows
2. **Team Collaboration**: Working with diverse skill sets helped us approach problems from different angles
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: The time constraint forced us to focus on core functionality and iterate quickly
4. **Future of Development**: We gained a deeper understanding of how AI will shape the future of software engineering

## The Experience

The hackathon was more than just a coding competition. It was a platform for:

- Networking with colleagues across different practices
- Learning from internal experts
- Experimenting with cutting-edge technologies
- Building solutions that could make a real impact

## Looking Forward

The AI Hackathon demonstrated the immense potential of AI in transforming traditional business processes. As we continue to explore this space, I'm excited to see how these innovations will transform not just software engineering, but entire industries like insurance.
