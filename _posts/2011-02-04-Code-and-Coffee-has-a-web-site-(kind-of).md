About 18 months ago some folks came of with the idea of getting together in the mornings and hacking on some code.  And so 'Code and Coffee' was born.  In Central Ohio, <a href="http://blog.timwingfield.com/">Tim Wingfield</a> got us all going.<br /><br />Fast forward to now and there sometimes 5 or 6 active Code and Coffee groups.  I know of groups in Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Toledo and 3 Columbus groups.<div><br /></div><div>During our 2/3/2011 sessions we saw this tweet about the number of people and locations.</div><div><br /></div><div><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PGI7uplJZmQ/TUw1SENZJdI/AAAAAAAAAEI/AP2Na2f0EIM/s400/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-02-04%2Bat%2B12.18.31%2BPM.png" style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 133px;" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569885423634294226" /><div><br /></div><div>Actually Tim had the idea a while ago to start an open source project to help us be a little more organized.  We have been working on it for a few months.  Today we moved a version to a staging environment.  You can see the work at <a href="http://codeandcoffee.heroku.com/">http://codeandcoffee.heroku.com</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>Our little project is called Zambia and it hosted at <a href="https://github.com/codeandcoffee/zambia">github</a>.  Our feature list is hosted at PivotalTracker.  If you want to help make it cool and useful, then fork it.  We'd be happy to have you!<br /><br /></div></div>
