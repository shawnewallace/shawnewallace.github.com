A value is a belief, a mission, or a philosophy that is meaningful.  Whether we are consciously aware of them or not, every individual has a core set of personal values.  Values can range from the commonplace, such as the belief in hard work and punctuality, to the more psychological, such as self-reliance, concern for others, and harmony of purpose.Below are the values that I hold dear.#Honesty
