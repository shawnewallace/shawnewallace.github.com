On January 3, 1990 I shipped off to Parris Island, South Carolina for Marine Recruit Training.  For the next six years I was an infantryman and and enlisted member of the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

While I often meet fellow veterans in my profession, I rarely meet Marines.  And much more rare, is the Infantry Marine.

The Marine Corps is by far then best in the world at what it does for an organization of it's size.  While many of the skills I gained during my time serving do not apply directly to my chosen profession of a software developer, the Marine Corps concepts of leadership, productivity and organization do.

The Marine Corps has two 'prime directives' that drive everything that they do.  I show them below in priority order.

The basic responsibilities of a leader are: Accomplishment of the mission and the welfare of the soldiers.

#Job 1 - Accomplish the Mission - 1B Welfare of the Troops
Ultimately the job is to do the job.  Do what has been asked


#You can only manage 3 people, MAX

#Overwhelming Force

#Immediate Action

#Training is Critically Important

#Operations Reduces Readiness

#You Do Not Get Better at Your Job by Doing Your Job

#Drilling and Training are DIFFERENT
