[Oris Intelligence, LLC](http://www.orisintel.com/)

Provides automated Minimum Advertized Price (MAP) monitoring and enforcement tools

Process 200,000 product pages every 3 hours. Wanted the ability to increase this volume by orders of magnitude.

Growing very quickly and were relying on an out of country company to provide the intelligence data that they needed.

* Needs to expand very quickly.
* Required the ability to add new producta and sites.
* Reliability was a concern
* Timeliness of adding new customers, existing backlog was estimated at about a year.
