## What I'm Working On

- Partnering with clients to **modernize legacy integration architectures**, moving from ESB-style middleware to an **API-first and event-driven approach** with Kafka/Schema Registry, an API Gateway, and contract-driven integrations.

- Building and refining a **reference architecture and reusable patterns library** for modern distributed systems — including event schema governance, observability, retries, and integration with legacy core systems.

- Leading assessments and roadmaps for **portal modernization**, especially where organizations are considering moving away from heavy SaaS ecosystems (like Salesforce Experience Cloud) toward **lightweight custom portals** that better fit architecture, cost, and long-term maintainability needs.

- Continuing deep work in **AI-assisted engineering**, including:
  - Agent-based development workflows  
  - Semantic logging and traceability  
  - AI-assisted reverse engineering  
  - Classification-based use cases (e.g., claim triage)

- Writing and speaking about AI, architecture, and development practices — focusing on practical implementation rather than hype.

## What I'm Learning & Reading

- Experimenting with hands-on applications from Microsoft Build 2025 — including event-driven AI workflows and applying Semantic Kernel in enterprise environments.
- Reading:  
	- I finished the **Wheel of Time Series**!!! 
  - I'm still on the path of having [several books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19801180-shawn-wallace) in the hopper at the same time.

## Life & Personal Focus

- Planning a 2-week September road trip through the **American West** — Yellowstone → Glacier → Utah’s National Parks → possibly the Grand Canyon. Lodges, not tents.
- Continuing to serve as an **Elder** at Amazing Grace Christian Church.
- Drafting a longer-form piece (and maybe a talk) on **what the Marine Corps taught me about engineering and leadership** — discipline, simplicity, ownership, and adaptability.

---

## What’s Coming Next

- Publishing internal and public content related to **Artificial Intelligence** explorations and applied proofs of concept.
- Launching an internal site for the **Software Engineering & Development offering**, capturing reusable guidance, working examples, and architectural consistency across engagements.
