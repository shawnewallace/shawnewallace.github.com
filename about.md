I'm a software architect, Marine veteran, and lifelong learner based in Columbus, Ohio. I spend my days helping organizations solve complex technical challenges, teaching the next generation of developers, and exploring how AI is changing the way we build software.

When I'm not working, you'll find me reading, tinkering with new technologies, or spending time with family. I've been at this since 1992, and I still find new problems to solve and new things to learn.
